# Code Wars Hackathon 2023

A Python project created as part of a hackathon challenge for Code Wars 2023. This repository contains code files developed during the hackathon, including game implementations and support scripts used to demonstrate core functionality and project concepts.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Code Wars Hackathon 2023 is a programming event where teams and individuals solve coding problems and build projects within a limited timeframe. This repository includes several Python scripts focused on solving specific tasks and building small interactive applications during the event.

Key parts of the repository include:

Python source files (*.py) implementing logic and functionality

Supporting assets and resources

Project configuration files

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project locally and explore what was built during the hackathon.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Install the following tools before running the project:

Python 3.10+

Optional (if a virtual environment is used):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows

## 📦 Install Dependencies

If the project uses any dependencies (see pyproject.toml):

pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, if you’re using Poetry:

poetry install

## 🏃‍♂️ Run the Code

To run the main script:

python formatted_main_frame.py

or to run the survival game script:

python survival_game_main_workings.py
